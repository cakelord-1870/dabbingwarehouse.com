<p>        So, you want in on the Terp Slurper Craze and don’t know where to start? Well, WE GOT YOU! I remember first researching “How to use a terp slurper,” and I didn’t have much luck on the subject. Most videos were just people jamming huge dabs into their Slurpers and didn’t help me much in answering the frequently asked questions - “How long do I heat up and cool down my terp slurper” or “when is the right time to drop my dab in a terp slurper?” All TERP SLURPERS AND TORCHES ARE NOT CREATED EQUAL, so keep in mind these times I mention might vary depending on your equipment, but this should give you a good baseline heat up and cool down time to start with! I have seen so many videos showing people heating their bangers or terp slurpers until they were glowing red and then instantly dropped their dab in. This is SO WRONG and should NEVER be done. The point of dabbing is to VAPORIZE your concentrate not to combust it. I like to use a baseline of 60 seconds of heat up time, spreading the heat around the terp slurper as best you can, focusing the heat on the bottom dish and center tube. I then like to wait about 40-60 seconds for the banger to cool down before dropping in the dab. The longer you wait, the less vapor production (cloud size) you will get, BUT the lower temps will allow the terpenes (cannabis flavonoids) in our extracts to survive and give us a better-tasting dabbing experience.</p>
<p>        To elaborate on that, if you drop your dab at a higher temp, it can burn off the terpenes, and then we don’t get those flavors we would want at lower temps. Some would say the negatives to these lower temp dabs are that sometimes you don’t get as big of a cloud, and physical effects can be slightly lighter. Another thing you need to consider is the TEXTURE of the dabs you're using. If you try to dab diamonds, you might need to drop them at a higher temp because the diamonds take a little more heat to melt than, say, a more buttery type concentrate. All of these variables play a role in getting that perfect Terp Slurper dab, but the most important thing, in my opinion, is to have fun with it! For real, though! Have fun, and don’t worry, it’s just a Quartz banger, and it was made for you to heat up &amp; cool down, so don’t baby it, heat that banger up, and GO FOR IT! I hope this tutorial and video help you in your next Terp Slurping or Dabbing experience!
